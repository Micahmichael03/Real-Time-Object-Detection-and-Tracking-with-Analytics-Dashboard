# Image File Placement Instructions

To ensure your images display correctly in the README.md, please follow these naming conventions:

## Required Images
1. Copy your first result image to: `assets/results_img1.png`
   - This should be an image showing object detection with bounding boxes

2. Copy your second result image to: `assets/analytics_dashboard.png`
   - This should be an image showing your Power BI dashboard

3. (Optional) Add a demo GIF as: `assets/demo.gif`
   - This should be a short demo of your system in action

## Important Notes
- **Avoid spaces in filenames** - Use underscores instead of spaces
- Ensure all images are placed in the `assets` directory
- Make sure image filenames match exactly what's in the README.md
- If you need to reference your original files:
  - `results_img(1).png` should be renamed to `results_img1.png`
  - `results_img(2).png` should be renamed to `analytics_dashboard.png`

## Verifying Images
After placing the images, view your README.md on GitHub to ensure the images display properly.
